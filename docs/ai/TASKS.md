# TASKS.md — AI Task Board

> Simple task board for AI agents and humans.
> Keep this file updated. Move tasks as they progress.
> One task = one checkbox. Be concrete enough that any agent can act on it.

## In Progress

- [ ] **Owner-driven (not agent work):** anamnesis engine + phonological analyzer
      iterations (uncommitted WIP on `main`). Agents must not touch
      `backend/services/anamnesis_engine.py`,
      `backend/services/phonological_analyzer.py`, or
      `backend/tests/test_phonological_analyzer.py` until this is settled.

---

## Next

Tasks ready to be picked up by an agent once the WIP above clears. Ordered by priority (top = highest).

- [ ] **M-6** (audit 2026-05-26) — Anamnese-Abschlusslogik: when the
      anamnesis is complete, generate a structured handoff that wires into
      the report flow. Likely overlaps with the in-progress owner work →
      coordinate before starting.
- [ ] Bump `actions/checkout` and `actions/setup-node` to versions that ship
      Node 24 natively, then remove the `FORCE_JAVASCRIPT_ACTIONS_TO_NODE24`
      env flag added in PR #6. No urgency — flag becomes a no-op after
      2026-06-02 either way.
- [ ] Fix the pre-existing Vercel preview deploy failure (separate
      deployment-config issue; ignore for CI green-up).
- [ ] Add UI loading skeletons for report generation (currently just spinner).
- [ ] Improve PDF export quality (layout, fonts, report structure).
- [ ] Expand backend test coverage for therapy-plan / SOAP / compare endpoints.

## Blocked

- **M-6** — blocked on owner's in-progress anamnesis work (see "In Progress").

---

## Parking Lot

- [ ] Gemini CLI integration: use Gemini for planning/review sessions to reduce Claude quota usage.
- [ ] SOAP notes UI improvement — currently raw text, could use structured display.
- [ ] Phonological analysis: add export to PDF.
- [ ] Consider adding session sharing / read-only report links.
- [ ] i18n: English version of the UI for broader portfolio appeal.
