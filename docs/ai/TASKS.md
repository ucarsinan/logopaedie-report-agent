# TASKS.md — AI Task Board

> Simple task board for AI agents and humans.
> Keep this file updated. Move tasks as they progress.
> One task = one checkbox. Be concrete enough that any agent can act on it.

## In Progress

- [ ] **Owner-driven (not agent work):** anamnesis engine + phonological analyzer
      iterations (uncommitted WIP on `main`). Agents must not touch
      `backend/services/anamnesis_engine.py`,
      `backend/services/phonological_analyzer.py`,
      `backend/services/anamnesis_catalog.py`, or
      `backend/tests/test_phonological_analyzer.py` until this is settled.

---

## Next

Tasks ready to be picked up by an agent once the WIP above clears. Ordered by priority (top = highest).

- [ ] **M-6** (audit 2026-05-26) — Anamnese-Abschlusslogik: when the
      anamnesis is complete, generate a structured handoff that wires into
      the report flow. Likely overlaps with the in-progress owner work →
      coordinate before starting.

### From 2026-05-29 performance audit (still open)

- [ ] After Postgres EXPLAIN confirms the composite indexes from migration 0011
      are picked, drop the now-redundant single-column `ix_reports_user_id`,
      `ix_patients_user_id`, and `ix_therapyplanrecord_user_id` in a follow-up.

### From 2026-06-01 I3 security/perf sweep (deferred items)

- [ ] **S-6** — `X-Forwarded-For` trust in preview deploys: `client_ip_key`
      in `backend/middleware/rate_limiter.py:55-69` only enforces the
      `TRUSTED_PROXY` gate when `_is_production()` returns true. In
      Vercel `preview` and any non-Vercel staging, an attacker can
      rotate per-IP buckets via crafted XFF. Needs deploy-env audit.
- [ ] **S-7** (informational) — `change_password` does not invalidate
      in-flight access tokens (only revokes other refresh sessions).
      Combined with the optimistic `get_optional_user` (no DB check),
      a stolen access token survives a password change up to its
      expiry. Would need a `jti`/`session_hash` block list keyed in
      Redis with TTL == access_token TTL.
- [ ] **S-8** (informational) — `get_optional_user` does not check
      `locked_until` / `email_verified` / `revoked_at`. Documented
      trade-off from `c0980ab`. Only safe while every consumer reads
      `user.id` and nothing else; add a runtime guard if more
      handlers adopt `AuthIdentity`.
- [ ] **P-1** — `GET /auth/sessions` has no `limit`/`offset`. Add
      `limit=Query(50, le=200)` + offset.
- [ ] **P-3** — `change_password` and `enable_2fa` revoke sessions
      via a Python `for ... db.add()` loop instead of a single
      `sa_update(UserSession).where(...).values(...)`. Mirror what
      `refresh()` does.
- [ ] **P-5** — `routers/reports.py` runs a `COUNT(*)` on a filtered
      subquery per list page. Return estimated count, or only
      compute exact count on page 1, or move to cursor pagination.
- [ ] **Rate-limit 429 headers** — `RateLimitExceeded` handler in
      `backend/main.py:162-167` returns a bare JSON body with no
      `Retry-After` / `X-RateLimit-*`. One-line follow-up for
      client back-off.

### From 2026-06-01 I2 test-coverage audit (deferred items)

- [ ] **`auth_service.start_2fa_setup` + `disable_2fa`** — J1 added
      audit-emit + rate-limit assertions but I2's full happy-path
      service unit suite is still missing. Add: provisioning URI
      shape, encrypted-secret round-trip, recovery-code generation;
      `disable_2fa` requires valid TOTP/recovery + audit emit;
      `login_2fa` challenge expiry + replay rejection (sync unit
      tests, not just route tests).
- [ ] **`patient_service` + `totp_service` error-path gap** — both
      have `raises=0` in their test files. Add: duplicate
      `system_id` collision; update on non-owned record; invalid
      date strings in `derive_age_group`; tampered ciphertext in
      `decrypt`; TOTP drift-window boundaries.

### Open follow-ups

- [ ] **Frontend `end-of-file-fixer` baseline** — visible after E1's
      pre-commit `--all-files` run. 5 `frontend/public/*.svg` files
      were missing trailing newlines and were fixed as part of `e089942`.
      No further frontend hygiene gap surfaced; leave as a watch item.

### Other

- [ ] Fix the pre-existing Vercel preview deploy failure (separate
      deployment-config issue; ignore for CI green-up).

## Done

- [x] **J-wave** (post-H-wave audit follow-ups) — three parallel sub-agents:
      J1 security bundle (S-1 email PII → SHA-256 email_hash; S-3 `/auth/2fa/setup` rate-limit `3/hour` + audit emit `user.2fa_setup_started`; S-4 `_audit` assert→RuntimeError; S-5 `hmac.compare_digest` for service-token bearer) — `869c77f`;
      J2 rate-limits `30/min` on `/auth/logout` + `GET/DELETE /auth/sessions` — `de96f6c`;
      J3 +9 tests for `session_store.save/get_or_raise/get_authorized`, +6 tests for `audit_service.query`, plus latent `_apply_0018` transaction fix from I1 Medium [3] — `102e592`. **474 passed, 9 skipped** (was 448+9). — 2026-06-01
- [x] **I-wave audits** (read-only): I1 H-wave code-review (caught Critical 0017 FK gap, see next item), I2 backend test-coverage audit (`session_store` + `audit_service.query` zero direct refs, etc.), I3 security/perf sweep (S-1 email PII, S-3 unaudited 2FA setup, etc.). Reports inline in chat; key findings captured in CURRENT.md "Key things the next agent should know". — 2026-06-01
- [x] **Critical fix: 0017 missing soaprecord+therapyplanrecord FK drops.** Migration would have failed on first Postgres deploy with "cannot alter type of a column used in a foreign key constraint". Added both to `_FK_SPECS`; `_column_is_varchar` guard correctly skips the redundant ALTER for their already-UUID columns. SQLite was no-op so CI never caught it. Caught by I1 review. (`bf04e8b`) — 2026-06-01
- [x] **Type-encoding cleanup (`VARCHAR(36)` → `UUID`) — 13/13 columns CLOSED.** 0008/0009 handled `reports.patient_id` + `soaprecord.user_id` early; 0013/0014/0015/0016 (E2 + G1/G2/G3) handled the 4 leaf PKs; 0017/0018 (H1/H2) closed the 9-column users.id + patients.id clusters via coordinated drop-FKs / ALTER-types / recreate-FKs pattern. `alembic check` clean end-to-end on the resulting 0001→0018 chain. (`a557a4f` + `b24d6ee` + earlier waves) — 2026-05-31
- [x] **F2** — explicit `@pytest.mark.asyncio` markers on 19 bare `async def test_*` across 3 backend test files (parallel sub-agent F2). Pure hygiene against potential future `asyncio_mode = "strict"` migrations; pytest counts unchanged. `import pytest` added to `test_email_service.py` (only touched file that was missing it) (`b5bca62`) — 2026-05-31
- [x] `0017_users_id_uuid_cluster` + `0018_patients_id_uuid_cluster` VARCHAR(36)→UUID alignment for the 9 columns clustered around `users.id` (7 cols: PK + 6 FKs) and `patients.id` (2 cols: PK + `consent_records.patient_id`) — parallel sub-agents H1/H2. Coordinated drop/ALTER/recreate-FKs pattern. Drift finding worth flagging: 0002 created 3 FKs inline without explicit names; 0017 renames them to canonical `fk_<table>_<col>_users` during recreate. Followup mypy cleanup (`0833506`) replaced `op.Operations.context()` with explicit `from alembic.operations import Operations` (`a557a4f` / `b24d6ee` / `0833506`) — 2026-05-31
- [x] `0014`+`0015`+`0016` VARCHAR(36)→UUID alignment for `email_tokens.id`, `user_sessions.id`, `consent_records.id` (parallel sub-agents G1/G2/G3). All leaf PKs, no incoming FKs; each migration mirrors `0013` pattern. 9 columns from A3's audit remain (all are FKs to `users.id` or `users.id` itself — coordinated cluster) (`facf364` / `559ed9f` / `aadea60`) — 2026-05-31
- [x] F1: T3's audit-logger re-enable scoped via `monkeypatch.setattr` (E3-review follow-up). Was a bare module-level mutation that would have leaked into later tests; now restored at teardown (`16aad7e`) — 2026-05-29
- [x] `0013_audit_log_id_uuid_type` migration (parallel sub-agent E2). Postgres-only conditional `ALTER TABLE audit_log ALTER COLUMN id TYPE uuid USING id::uuid`, SQLite no-op via dialect gate. Proof-of-pattern for the broader `VARCHAR(36)→UUID` cleanup; chose `audit_log.id` as safest first target (no incoming FKs to cascade-break). `test_migration_0013.py` covers SQLite no-op + Postgres-only skip-marker (`0e5d302`) — 2026-05-29
- [x] Ruff version skew + I001 baseline cleared (parallel sub-agent E1). Real root cause was NOT a hook-id circular conflict — it was a version pin skew (`.pre-commit-config.yaml` and `requirements-dev.txt` both pinned ruff 0.11.12, dev CLI was 0.15.10). Bumped both to 0.15.15, renamed deprecated `id: ruff` → `id: ruff-check`. `ruff check .` → All checks passed!. Also fixed 5 SVG trailing-newline issues surfaced by `pre-commit run --all-files` (`e089942`) — 2026-05-29
- [x] Code-review pass on `3d57bc1` (D1) + `44ff83b` (D2) by parallel sub-agent E3. No Critical, one High (F1, applied), two Medium (F2 deferred, M2 informational), four Lows (all confirmations that D2 is correct). Approval: both safe to keep as landed. Risk: Low (report inline in chat) — 2026-05-29
- [x] M4: `AuthService.refresh` happy path now emits `event="user.token_refreshed"` audit row (parallel sub-agent D2). Metadata: `{"old_session_id": ..., "new_session_id": ...}`. Route was already wired with `background_tasks` + `db_factory` from B1; only the svc-side emit was missing (`44ff83b`) — 2026-05-29
- [x] T1 + T2 + T3 end-to-end tests for the BackgroundTasks audit path (parallel sub-agent D1): T1 drives `log_in_background` directly + asserts fresh-session landing; T2 hits admin lock route + asserts row via `GET /admin/audit`; T3 monkeypatches `Session.commit` to raise + asserts the worker swallows + `logger.exception` is called. T3 verified by removing the `except` clause and watching it fail (`3d57bc1`) — 2026-05-29
- [x] Code-review hardening on `6c18482` (parallel sub-agent C3 + M2 follow-up): `AuthService._audit` now asserts `(background is None) == (db_factory is None)` so partial wiring fails loud instead of silently degrading to the sync path (`222c708`) — 2026-05-29
- [x] `ix_patients_pseudonym` drift resolution (parallel sub-agent C2): dropped the `index=True` declaration from `Patient.pseudonym` (call-site audit showed only `ILIKE '%q%'` searches always co-anded with `user_id`/`deleted_at`; `idx_patients_user_active` from 0011 covers the access path); removed the entry from `_MIGRATION_ONLY_INDEXES` so `alembic check` now actively guards against re-introducing it (`90c51e3`) — 2026-05-29
- [x] BackgroundTasks audit-wiring audit (parallel sub-agent C1): grep confirmed every audit emit site in the codebase was already converted in `6c18482` — `reports.py`, `sessions.py`, `soap.py`, etc. don't emit audit events. No code change required; HANDOFF's anticipation of "remaining routers" was incorrect. (No commit.) — 2026-05-29
- [x] `test_no_api_key_references` exclusion fix (parallel sub-agent B3): switched from absolute `path.parts` to `relative_to(root).parts`; added `.claude` + `worktrees` to the exclusion set so agent-worktree dispatch no longer false-fails the suite (`33c542e`) — 2026-05-29
- [x] `0012_align_declared_fks` migration + `alembic check` CI guard (parallel sub-agent B2): emits 7 declared-but-missing FKs idempotently (no-op on Neon for therapyplanrecord), tunes `alembic/env.py` (add `models.patient` import, `compare_type=False`, `include_object` filter), CI step runs after pytest (`6e31983`) — 2026-05-29
- [x] `audit_service.log()` writes deferred via FastAPI BackgroundTasks (parallel sub-agent B1): new `log_in_background` + `get_db_factory` plumbing in `database.py`; sync `log()` preserved for test direct-callers; routes in auth/auth_admin/patients wire the deferred path (`6c18482`) — 2026-05-29
- [x] Schema-vs-migrations static audit (parallel sub-agent A3) — report at `docs/ai/AUDIT_2026-05-29_schema.md`; sketches `0012_align_declared_fks` migration + `alembic check` CI step (no code commit) — 2026-05-29
- [x] Auth email path async end-to-end: `register` / `reset_request` / `resend` handlers + `AuthService.register` / `request_password_reset` / `resend_verification` + `EmailService.send_*` all async; `_run_send` sync bridge dropped (`0467587`) — 2026-05-29
- [x] `get_optional_user` JWT optimization: new `AuthIdentity` dataclass; per-request DB fetch removed from session-router endpoints; `get_current_user` chains on it for routers that need the full `User` row (`c0980ab`) — 2026-05-29
- [x] `GET /patients/{id}/history` pagination + `EmailService._send` async seam (`64800ce`) — 2026-05-29
- [x] Production assertions: `TRUSTED_PROXY` for rate-limiter, `SERVICE_TOKEN` for service-token middleware; flaky rate-limit tests hardened via unique per-test `X-Forwarded-For` IPs (`4117ae9`) — 2026-05-29
- [x] A11y/cleanup batch: skip-link, WorkflowStepper nav semantics, PatientPickerModal role placement, dark-mode `--muted-foreground` contrast, `useRegister` dead branch (`d8ea14e`) — 2026-05-29
- [x] A11y batch: nav `aria-current="page"`, icon-button labels, `motion-reduce` guards, input labels in TherapyPlanModule/SuggestModule/PhonologyModule, AuditLogTable `scope="col"`, ChatBubble SVG `aria-hidden`, ReportPreview disclaimer `role="alert"` (`f715700`) — 2026-05-29
- [x] Redis client singleton + duplicate SessionStore removal + migration 0011 with composite/partial indexes on reports/patients/therapyplanrecord (`5af7c4a`) — 2026-05-29
- [x] Security batch: rate limits on 6 previously-unlimited auth endpoints, `auto_verified` leak removed, audit offset capped (`c44de76`) — 2026-05-29
- [x] OnboardingOverlay real dialog with focus trap + Escape + focus rings (`5672716`) — 2026-05-29
- [x] PDF render offloaded to worker thread via `asyncio.to_thread` (`bbbe5ce`) — 2026-05-29
- [x] Logout BFF actually revokes backend session by forwarding `refresh_token` (`24eef4e`) — 2026-05-29
- [x] GeneratingView test moved into `__tests__/` for convention alignment (`6b37ba0`/`60a18c6`) — 2026-05-29
- [x] `_make_footer` mock pinned so `canvas._generated_at` is deterministic (`6b37ba0`) — 2026-05-29
- [x] TherapyPlanModule dead `sessionId` prop removal (`241f7fd`) — 2026-05-28
- [x] SOAPModule.generateFromReport stale-session 404 recovery (`11ce3cd`) — 2026-05-28
- [x] Therapy-plan ownership enforcement across GET-list / GET-by-id / PUT,
      plus test-file consolidation (`9c27c7e`) — 2026-05-28
- [x] PDF export typography, layout, and thread-safe per-render context
      (`6840168`) — 2026-05-28

## Blocked

- **M-6** — blocked on owner's in-progress anamnesis work (see "In Progress").

---

## Parking Lot

- [ ] Gemini CLI integration: use Gemini for planning/review sessions to reduce Claude quota usage.
- [ ] SOAP notes UI improvement — currently raw text, could use structured display.
- [ ] Phonological analysis: add export to PDF.
- [ ] Consider adding session sharing / read-only report links.
- [ ] i18n: English version of the UI for broader portfolio appeal.
